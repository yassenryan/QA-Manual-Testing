# SauceDemo – Manual Testing Project

## Overview
This is a **self-assigned manual testing project** for the [SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com) website.  
The project demonstrates how requirements and application behavior are analyzed and converted into **structured manual test cases** following QA best practices.

## User Story
As a user, I want to **login, browse products, add items to the cart, and complete checkout** so that I can make online purchases successfully and securely.

## Acceptance Criteria Covered
